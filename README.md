# Password Strength Checker

## Overview
This is a simple Python application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to check the strength of their passwords. The application evaluates the password based on several criteria, including length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

It provides real-time feedback on password strength and offers suggestions for improving weak passwords.

## Features
- Password strength evaluation based on:
  - Length of the password
  - Uppercase letters
  - Lowercase letters
  - Numbers
  - Special characters
- Visual feedback with a strength meter (color-coded background).
- Suggestions to improve weak passwords.
- Written in Python using Tkinter for the GUI and Regular Expressions (`re`) for password validation.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Tkinter (usually comes pre-installed with Python)
- No external libraries are required (besides Python's built-in libraries).

## Installation
1. Clone the repository or download the project files to your local machine.
2. Install Python if you don't already have it installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/
3. If Tkinter is not installed, you can install it using:
   - For Windows: It comes bundled with Python.
   - For Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install python3-tk
     ```
   - For macOS: It should also come pre-installed with Python.

4. Navigate to the project folder and run the Python script:
   ```bash
   python password_checker_gui.py# Password Strength Checker
